
Yaafe and Windows

Yaafe also compiles on MS Windows ;)


Windows Cross-Compilation
=========================

I managed to cross-compile Yaafe for windows (Linux host) using the MXE environment:
http://mxe.cc/
The same should be possible using a Mac OS X host.

1. Setup MXE on your system:
- Download MXE (or use git):
  git clone -b stable https://github.com/mxe/mxe.git
- Follow the MXE installation instructions:
  http://mxe.cc/#tutorial
- Set MXE target to: i686-w64-mingw32.static
- Compile Yaafe dependencies (in MXE directory):
  make gcc pthreads cmake
  NOTE: no need to compile everything!

2. Compile argtable:
- Download argtable:
  wget http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/argtable/argtable2-13.tar.gz
- tar xvfz argtable2-13.tar.gz && rm argtable2-13.tar.gz
- mkdir path/to/your/install-dir
- Compile argtable with MXE:
  - ./configure --host=i686-w64-mingw32.static --disable-shared --enable-static --prefix=path/to/your/install-dir
  - make
  - make install

3. Compile Yaafe:
- change to Yaafe directory
- mkdir build && cd build
- cmake -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=/path/to/your/mxe/usr/i686-w64-mingw32.static/share/cmake/mxe-conf.cmake -DWITH_FFTW3=OFF -DWITH_HDF5=OFF -DWITH_LAPACK=OFF -DWITH_MATLAB_MEX=OFF -DWITH_SNDFILE=OFF -DWITH_MPG123=OFF -DWITH_TIMERS=OFF -DARGTABLE2_INCLUDE_DIR=/path/to/your/argtable/install-dir/include -DARGTABLE2_LIBRARY=/path/to/your/argtable/install-dir/lib/libargtable2.a ..
- make
- Here are your Yaafe binaries (dlls) and you can use them in MS Windows!

NOTE:
- I disabled many Yaafe features in the above example!
- If you need these additional features (e.g. libsndfile, fftw, lapack, mpg123, ...) you also have to compile them first - most of them are already included in MXE!


Windows Native Compilation
==========================

Native compilation under windows should be very similar to the description above, if you use the MingW compiler (gcc):
